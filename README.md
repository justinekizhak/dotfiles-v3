## Introduction

They say your dotfiles will most likely be the longest project you ever work on.
So for this reason, your dotfiles must be organized in a disciplined manner for 
maintainability and extensibility.   
My dotfiles are the direct reflection of my software development workflow and 
practices of my past 3 years.   
My dotfiles have undergone many transformation from single file vimrc to
forking someone else's to building a simple yet sophisticated structure for
housing more dotfiles.   
One thing you may notice is that my workflow consists of diverse toolkit, 
this makes it for easier adoption and exploration.

## Get Started

1) `git clone https://gitlab.com/justinekizhak/dotfiles`

2) Use instructions in `install.yaml` file.
  Just copy paste lines in the file into terminal.
  All instructions are bash compatible.

Instead of cloning I would strongly suggest forking. I make lots of changes
to my dotfiles, which you may or may not like.  
And also forking will help you in experimentation.
